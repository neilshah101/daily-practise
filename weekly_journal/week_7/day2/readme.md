# Activity 1 - Hello Server Side Pages

In this activity, you will create a Mustache server side pages app. When the user goes to the home page **"/"** then prints **"Hello World"** on the page.

# Activity 2 - Submitting Form

In this activity, you will create a view called **"add-customer.mustache"**. The view will allow the user to enter their name and age. When the user presses the submit button the values (name and age) will be posted to **"/add-customer"** (POST) endpoint. 

Inside **"/add-customer"** route you will extract the name and age and pass it down to the "confirmation.mustache" view which will display the following message. 

The customer John with age 32 has been saved successfully

* John and 32 are just examples, you will be passing the values which you received from the FORM. 

# TRIP PLANNING 
You are in charge of creating a website for tracking trips. You will use server side pages using Mustache or any other server side template framework for this assignment. 

Your app should allow users to do the following: 

- Ability to add a new trip. A new trip consists of title, image, date of departure, date of return 

- Ability to view all the trips (A sample screenshot is shown below. Screenshot is just for demoing purposes you can design your app however you want) 

- Ability to delete a trip (Do this last, since deleting a trip is difficult. Hint - You can have multiple forms) 

* Your app should work on mobile devices 

* Google Trips is a good app for inspiration and ideas! (Available on the App Store)
