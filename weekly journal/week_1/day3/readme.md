# Activity 1 - Loops 

In this activity, you will learn how to loop over an array. 

1. Create a friends array and initialize it with names of 5-6 of your friends 
2. Write a for loop to loop through the friends array and display your friend name on the terminal



# Activity 2 - Reverse Loop 

In this activity, you will learn how to run a loop in reverse order. 

1. Create an array and initialize it with list of numbers. 

2. Run a for loop in reverse order, so the last number in the array is printed first on the terminal. 



# Activity 3 - Reverse a String 

In this activity, you will learn how to reverse a string. 

1. Ask user to input a word as a string using the `input` function 

2. Run a loop in reverse order and print individual character of the word on the terminal 

3. Inside the loop construct a reverse word and print it on the terminal 

Example: 

```
word = cat 

reverse word = tac 
```


# Activity 4 - While Loop 

In this activity, you are going to enter your friend's name using the `input` function continuously inside a while loop. The while loop will end when the user enter "q" (without quotes) to quit.

Also make sure to add your friend's name to an array and print the array after right after the end of while loop. 

```
while(some condition): 
    code ...
    code ...

print(friends) # friends is an array 
```


# Assignment:  Factorial 

Assignment 1 - Write an app which asks users for the input and then prints the factorial for that number. 

----------------------------------------------------------

# Assignment: Palindrome 

Create an app which detects if the input word is a palindrome or not. 

Palindromes are strings which when read from left to right are same as right to left. Examples below: 
```
mom 

dad 

madam 
```

The following strings are NOT palindrome: 

```
cat != tac 

car != rac 

bus = sub 
```

* Hint - You can loop through a String. A String can be accessed like an array. 

`word = "Car" -> word[1] = "a"`

---------------------------------------------------------

# Assignment 3: Prime or Not

Take input from the user and find out if that number is prime or not.
