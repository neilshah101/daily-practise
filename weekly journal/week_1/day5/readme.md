# Activity - Bubble Sort

Write an application which applies the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list/array of numbers. 

Your app should start with an integer array similar to this: 

`numbers = [2,1,45,67,89,4,5,7,9]`

After applying bubble sort you will end up with the sorted array. 

`[1,2,4,5,7,9,45,67,89]   (Ascending Order)` 

You can also sort the array in decending order as shown below: 

`[89,67,45,9,7,5,4,2,1]`


* Hint: You may need two loops to perform bubble sort

# Algorithms

1) Return the number of perfect squares (like 4, 16, 25, 36, etc.) between two integers a and b, inclusive
 

2) Write a Python program to calculate the value of 'a' to the power 'b'. 

Test Data :

(power(3,4) -> 81 

3) Write a program that calculate the number of vowels used in a sentence. 

Example: 
```
input = "The elephant is walking in the enclosure!"

Output: 

e = 5 

a = 2 

i = 2
```
 

4). The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..`

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation 

    `Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2`
 

with seed values 
 

 

   `F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.`
 


**Question**

If we list all the natural numbers below 30 that are multiples of 7 or 11, we get 7, 11, 14 and 21 and 28. The sum of these multiples is 81.

Using python write figure out how you could find and return the sum of all the multiples of 7 or 11 below 1000.
